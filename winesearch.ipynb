       "129954  One of the more characterful Pinot Gris for this price, Ara's 2013 offers wet stone and apple aromas, flavors of apple, cinnamon and pear and a long, mouthwatering finish. There's a bit of creaminess on the midpalate and just a hint of dusty texture on the finish.                                                                                                                           \n",

Hints of toasted almond and some riper notes of pear provide a certain amount of breadth on the palate, but citrus and quince dominate, lingering on the crisp finish.

       "129956  The blend is 44% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 22% Malbec. The result is a medium- to full-bodied wine with firm structure that should drink well through 2020. Leather, earth and plum notes pick up hints of black olive and espresso on the finish.                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "129957  Lightly baked berry aromas vie for attention with leather, spice and mild earth notes, and the result is disjointed. On the palate, this is tight as a drum initially, but more expansive as it unfolds. Cherry, plum, raspberry, vanilla and woodspice flavors finish pure, clean and easy. This is a fine yet manageable Rioja that's not trying too hard. Drink through 2016.                   \n",
